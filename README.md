## Mission
Welcome to a transformative initiative that harnesses the power of AI-generated content, bridging the realms of art and poetry to explore their untapped potential in the creative world.

In this project, Firefly is employed to craft breathtaking artwork, while ChatGPT lends its literary prowess to craft the poem, a reflection of my current mindset. This year has proven challenging, marked by two unexpected turns of events, yet my resolve remains unshaken.

## Installation
This demo is simply HTML, JS and CSS project, no installation needed
